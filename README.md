# Learning Machines Learning Machine Learning 
The original title was a bit long for the file name. This repository is a self-study on the way Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) work. The intenton of it is to allow the author (and hopefully with enough documentation, the reader) to learn the guts of how popular MLAs actually operate. The entire repository is built exclusively with the standard Java library.

## Versioning
Does not follow SemVer standards. The right most number per each MLA will increase on edits. I figure the MLAs will ideally improve on every version in terms of how effectively they converge. Secondly, I don't really have and end goal for this repository and following SemVer standards seemed... misleading at best and dishonest at worst.
